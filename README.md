# Covid-Visualizer

Covid visualizer application based on the SIR model. More information about the model and explanation <a href="https://scipython.com/book/chapter-8-scipy/additional-examples/the-sir-epidemic-model/">here</a>. I based my work on the mentioned model and added a gui written in Tkinter to make it user-friendly.
